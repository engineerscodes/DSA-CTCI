minitue hand will be 'On T'. if the time is 07:00 then the hour hand will be 'On P' and minute hand will be 'On Z'.
Only valid time will be given as input, hour will be given from 0 to 24 and minitue will be from 0 to 59.

First line contains the letter from which the numbering starts

Next line contains the hour of the time

Next line contains minute of the time

Output Format

In the first line, print the position of hour hand â€“ Print On a particular letter or Between two letters

In the next line, print the position of minute hand
